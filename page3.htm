<td><h5><font color="black" size="0">The Honda Civic Type R (Japanese: ホンダ・シビックタイプR, Hepburn: Honda Shibikku Taipuāru) is a series of hot hatchback and sports sedan models based on the Civic, developed and produced by Honda since September 1997. The first Civic Type R was the third model to receive Honda's Type R badge (after the NSX and Integra). Type R versions of the Civic typically feature a lightened and stiffened body, specially tuned engine, and upgraded brakes and chassis, and are offered only in five- or six-speed manual transmission. Like other Type R models, red is used in the background of the Honda badge to distinguish it from other models. Here are some color variations of recent Type R's.</font></h5></td>

<td><h5><font color="black" size="0">The Toyota Fortuner is the best-selling midsize SUV in the Philippines. This ladder-frame vehicle has been around since the early 2000s and has since become a household name thanks to its rugged platform and tested durability thanks to its robust platform and strong brand support. The second-generation model has been consistently topping the sales chart, not only in its segment but for the entire Philippine automotive industry as well. Fast-forward to October 2020, and the Toyota Motor Philippines finally brings in the updated version of the midsize SUV.</font></h5></td>
